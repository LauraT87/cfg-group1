            In your quest for a balanced life, have you neglected your hobbies? As children, we are experts at finding
             hobbies. We play sports, take dance and music lessons, collect action figures and spend our days learning
              everything from languages to wood shop. But somewhere on the path to adulthood, we stop trying new 
              things and spend less time on our non-career interests. It’s not too late. Use this guide to get 
              inspired, spark your interests and follow your passion toward a new hobby.

                    Finding a hobby can mean taking the first step to actively pursue that thing you’ve always thought about doing. Have you ever started a sentence with the words “I’ve always wanted to...”? A friend of mine had always been intrigued by power tools, so at the age of 52 she finally walked into the local senior center’s wood shop. (She was carded to make sure she was over 50.) There she found a retired carpenter who was willing to teach her about wood shop safety and mentor her on some projects. She has built a chair, a bench, a stool and beautiful boxes and given them away to friends.            </div>

                    One of the first places to look for inspiration in the search for a hobby is to explore the hobbies of your childhood. Think about what pursuits made you happy as a child. Did you take lessons in dance, music, ice skating or art? Did you play a sport? Did you love to draw, paint, take part in theater or write poems? All of these childhood pursuits can be turned into adult hobbies.            </div>

                <button class="btn btn-link collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseThree" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree">
                    Go on a quest for inspiration.
                </button>

                    Sometimes it takes a few extra steps (literally) to discover a potential hobby. Just walking around a craft store amid the chalk, paints, scrapbooks and bric-a-brac might remind you of an old passion or a fun craft you always wanted to try. Sometimes just enjoying new experiences can spark interest in a hobby. Visiting an art gallery or museum might remind you that you always wanted to paint or learn how to throw ceramics. Going to a concert might spark your interest in learning the cello.             </div>
